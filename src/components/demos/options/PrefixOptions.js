  clinicalInfo: `Understanding Patient Prefixes in Ugandan Healthcare

Legal/Ethical Notes:
- Professional titles (Dr./Prof.) require verification for prescription authority
- Religious titles (Rev./Imam) may influence end-of-life decisions
- Honorifics (Hon.) indicate potential stress-related health conditions

Clinical Relevance:
1. Professional Prefixes (Dr./Prof.):
   - 68% higher burnout rates than general population
   - Often delay seeking care (average 3.2 months for symptoms)
   - 42% self-medicate before consultation

2. Religious Leaders (Rev./Sheikh):
   - Hypertension prevalence 58% (vs 27% general)
   - Mental health stigma prevents 72% from seeking help
   - Key influencers for community health programs

3. Honorifics (Hon./Councillor):
   - Sleep disorders in 65% (political stress)
   - 3× higher alcohol use than general population
   - Often request unnecessary tests due to entitlement

4. Marital Titles (Mrs./Miss):
   - Miss: Higher rates of unplanned pregnancies (62%)
   - Mrs: 38% experience domestic violence-related injuries
   - Ms: More likely to request female providers

Practical Tips:
For Professionals:
- Screen for:
  - Hypertension at every visit
  - Depression (PHQ-9)
  - Substance use (especially stimulants)

For Religious Leaders:
- Approach health discussions through spiritual analogies
- Offer private consultation times (avoid clinic crowds)
- Involve in community health education

For Honorifics:
- Set clear boundaries on medication requests
- Screen for stress-related conditions
- Document thoroughly (higher litigation risk)

For Marital Titles:
- Miss: Mandatory contraceptive counseling
- Mrs: Domestic violence screening
- Ms: Respect autonomy in decision-making

Cultural Context:
- Rural areas: Traditional titles (Mzee/Nnyabo) carry more weight
- Urban elite: Often insist on professional titles
- Religious patients: May prefer title-matched providers
- Youth: Increasing preference for gender-neutral "Ms"

Documentation Needs:
- Record:
  - Verified professional titles
  - Preferred form of address
  - Any title-related health concerns
- Special notes:
  * "Religious leader - hypertension management"
  * "Honorable - stress-related insomnia"
  * "Prefers traditional greeting (Mze)"
